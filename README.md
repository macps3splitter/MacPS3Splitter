# MacPS3Splitter
Simple app for splitting PS3 pkg and ISO files

A front end for `gsplit` which allows you to just drag and drop `pkg` and `ISO` or other individual files in order to split them into 4GB chunks which you can transfer on a FAT32 USB drive to your PS3.

To use, download and unzip the `MacPS3Splitter.app.zip` file, then drag and drop a file to split it.  The chunks will be output to the same directory as the original file.
